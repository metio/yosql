# YoSQL

> write more SQL!

`YoSQL` is a [yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) inspired persistence solution for [Java](https://www.java.com/).

## Features

### Database-first

`YoSQL` works by converting SQL statements into executable Java code.

### Zero Dependency

`YoSQL` is a true zero dependency solution. Instead of adding a new dependency to your project, `YoSQL` is 
implemented as Maven/Gradle plugin that generates Java code based on SQL code.

### Flexibility

`YoSQL` recognizes that lots of project already have an existing persistence layer in place. Instead of forcing 
users to rewrite big parts of their software, `YoSQL` adapts to your project and supports a wide selection of 
persistence APIs.
