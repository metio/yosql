- DDL statements
- DML statements with update counts
- SELECT statements with results (although I'm a bit unclear about how to receive results, thus looking forward to examples)
- Batch statements with sets of update counts
- Simple stored procedures with IN/OUT parameters
- Statement batches and procedure calls with unknown update count / result set / exception streams (mostly for MySQL and SQL Server)
- javax.sql.Connection as first parameter for more fine-grained transaction management
- "inline" SQL statements, "textblock" for java 15, "external" for loading from .sql files
- multi-select statements: Repositories prepare a statement, GlobalRepository (or similar) executes all statements together using a single connection
- rename all config options according to new naming scheme (and define new naming scheme)
- date in @Generated annotations should be optional for reproducible builds
