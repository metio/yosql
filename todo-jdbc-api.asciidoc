- DDL statements
- DML statements with update counts
- SELECT statements with results (although I'm a bit unclear about how to receive results, thus looking forward to examples)
- Batch statements with sets of update counts
- Simple stored procedures with IN/OUT parameters
- Statement batches and procedure calls with unknown update count / result set / exception streams (mostly for MySQL and SQL Server)
