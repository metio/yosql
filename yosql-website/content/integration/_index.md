This part of the documentation is intended for **developers** looking for information on how to customize `YoSQL` beyond its [main configuration](../configuration) capabilities. Depending on what you what to achieve, we suggest following the steps:

0. Raise Ticket: Consider raising a ticket in case an additional configuration option would enable your use case.
1. Single-use `YoSQL`: Copy generated classes into your `src/main/java` folder and adapt them your own needs.
2. Extend `YoSQL`: Write your own code generator for maximal configurability.
3. Fork `YoSQL`: Fork the entire project for maximal control.
