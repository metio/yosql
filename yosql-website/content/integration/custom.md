It's quite likely that you want more or different code than currently generated by `YoSQL`. We suggest, to follow these steps in order to achieve your desired result:

1. Existing Configuration: Check the [main configuration](/configuration) section whether any configuration option allows you to do what you want.
2. Raise Ticket: Consider raising a ticket in case there is no such configuration.
3. Single-use `YoSQL`: Copy generated classes into your `src/main/java` folder and adapt them your own needs.
4. Extend `YoSQL`: Write your own code generator for maximal configurability.
5. Fork `YoSQL`: Fork the entire project for maximal control.
