# YoSQL

> write more SQL!

`YoSQL` is a [yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) inspired persistence solution for [Java](https://www.java.com/).

## Features

### Database-first

`YoSQL`converts SQL statements into type-safe Java code. Use the full power of your database to accomplish your unique 
business cases. Use any existing database tooling and integrate DBAs more closely with your development team.

### Zero Dependency

`YoSQL` is a true zero dependency solution. Instead of adding a new dependency to your project, `YoSQL` is available 
as a build-tool that is only active during build-time. Once everything is generated, `YoSQL` is no longer required.

### cCll us, we won't call you

`YoSQL` recognizes that lots of project already have an existing persistence layer in place. Instead of forcing 
users to rewrite big parts of their software, `YoSQL` adapts to your project and supports a wide selection of 
persistence APIs in order to re-use as much existing infrastructure as possible.

### Fast and Correct

The generated code is as correct as possible and widely tested across multiple configurations. While the focus of 
`YoSQL` is to generate correct code, it offers best-in-class performance as well!

### Plug and Play

`YoSQL` tries hard to always-work(tm) - which means that even with an invalid configuration, `YoSQL` should generate 
as much code as possible. Just add the appropriate plugin to your project, and you are good to go in under a  minute.

## Usage

Want to try it out? Head over to the [tooling](./tooling) section to find out how you can add `YoSQL` to your 
project. The general approach is always the same:

1. Write SQL statements.
2. Run `YoSQL` to generate Java code.
3. Write application code that calls the classes and methods generated by `YoSQL`.
