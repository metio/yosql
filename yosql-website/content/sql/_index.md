The following pages describe how to write SQL statements in a project using `YoSQL`.

There are multiple ways to [structure](./structure/) your [SQL files](./sql-files/) - choose whatever fits best to your project. Each of your `.sql` files can have an optional [front matter](./frontmatter/) part that can be used to fine-tine a single SQL statement. [Converters](./converters) can be used to return strong domain objects from your projects.
