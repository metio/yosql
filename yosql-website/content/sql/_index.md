This part of the documentation is intended for **developers** looking for information on how to write SQL statements in 
their own project.

There are multiple ways to [structure](./structure/) your [SQL files](./sql-files/) - choose whatever fits best to your project. Each of your `.sql` files can have an optional [front matter](./frontmatter/) part that can be used to fine-tine a single SQL statement. [Converters](./converters) can be used to return strong domain objects from your projects.
