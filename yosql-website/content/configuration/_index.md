This part of the documentation is intended for **developers** looking for information on the various configuration options that `YoSql` provides.

By default, `YoSQL` generates code that uses all features of the latest supported Java release without using any non-JDK classes. In case you don't want to use a particular feature, use the relevant configuration option to disable it. We recommend to start with an empty configuration and adapting that to your needs, using as many configuration options as required.
