<project_root>/
└── src/

        └── yosql/
            └── user/
                └── getAllUsers.sql
----

The SQL statements in your .sql files are just plain SQL, e.g. you can save the following statement in a file called
`getAllUsers.sql`:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT  *
FROM    users
----

YoSQL fill use the name of the file (`getAllUsers`) as the generated method name and the name of the enclosing folder
as the prefix for the generated repository. The final result is a new Java class called `UserRepository` which has a
method called `getAllUsers`.

== Using parameters

YoSQL supports named parameters only. They must have the form `:parameter`.

[source]
----
<project_root>/
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── yosql/
            └── user/
                ├── findUser.sql
                └── getAllUsers.sql
----

The newly added `findUser.sql` file could look like the following and causes YoSQL to add another method named
`findUser` to the same `UserRepository` class.

[source, sql]
----
SELECT  *
FROM    users
WHERE   id = :userId
----

The `findUser` method will expect one parameter (`userId`).
