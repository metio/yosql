YoSQL has an ever growing list of configuration options. You do not have to use every single one of them. Instead start with the defaults and adapt the generated code with the options listed below. In order to make it easier to find related options, they are being grouped into the following categories:

== Options that influence all generated classes

- link:classGeneratedAnnotation.asciidoc[classGeneratedAnnotation]: Should `@Generated` annotations be added to generated classes?

== Options that influence generated repositories

- link:basePackageName.asciidoc[basePackageName]: The base package name for the generated code

== Options that influence generated converters

- converterPackageName: The package name suffix for the generated converters.

== Options that influence how YoSQL is executed

- link:maxThreads.asciidoc[maxThreads]: The maximum number of threads to use.
